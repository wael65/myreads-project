# MyReads Project
I used React to build an app that allows selecting and categorizing books between three shelves; Currently read, Want to read, and Read. The app also allows searching for a book by book's name or author and moving books from a current shelf to a new one.

# Getting Started
  * Installing Dependencies
         npm install 

  * Run the project
         npm  strat 
    the app will run on the localhost:3000

# How to use the app
For moving a book from the current shelf, click the arrow on the book bottom corner and select the target shelf; the book will move to the intended one.
To search for a book, click the arrow on the page bottom corner to load the search page, then input the name of the book or author, the matched books will be loaded; you can move anyone to the intended shelf with the same procedure of moving books between shelves.
For returning to the main page, click the arrow on the upper search page corner.
